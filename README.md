# School_District_Analysis
## Challenge Overview 
This project was created to analyze student funding and standardized test scores to understand each school's performance. To do the analysis, we had to complete the following tasks 

1. Collect the student data into a DataFrame
2. Prepare a cleaned version of the DataFrame.
3. Summarize key pieces of the data.
4. Drill down into the data to analyze specific subsets.
5. Compare and contrast the data through grouping and aggregation functions.

## Resources
- Data source: new_full_student_data.csv
- Software: Pandas, Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8

## Results
- There is a greater average in reading scores than math scores among the students.
- The public schools have more budget, but they do not have a greater performance in reading and math scores than the charter schools.
